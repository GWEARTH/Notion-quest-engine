🎮 My Notion Game Automation
This repository powers my personal game that runs on top of Notion.
It is essentially a self-serving automation tool:

The game itself is played and managed via Notion (as the UI).

This repo contains scripts & workflows (via GitHub Actions) to automate the backend logic.

The scripts fetch data from Notion, process it, and write the results back to Notion.

📝 About the Game
The game is experimental and designed for personal use.
It is not a standalone product, and it relies entirely on my Notion setup & databases.

Features:

Takes input from Notion pages.

Runs scheduled or manual backend logic.

Outputs results back into Notion.

Uses relations, rollups, and cron-based automation via GitHub Actions + Zapier (optional).

⚙️ About this Repo
🛠️ Note: This repository is intended for my own workflows —
the code here is specific to my Notion workspace and game design.

There is no reusable or production-grade code in this repo.

The logic is hardcoded to my game’s structure & Notion page IDs.

No guarantees of clean APIs, documentation, or general usefulness.

If you’re curious or looking for inspiration, feel free to explore — but please understand it’s not meant as a development library or template.

🔒 Security
Any secrets (like Notion tokens or page IDs) are stored in GitHub Actions Secrets.

They are not included in the code, even in this public repo.

🙋 Why is it public?
I made this repo public simply for transparency and archival.
It is not a polished or reusable project — it’s a personal backend tool for my Notion-based game.
